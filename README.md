# 🛒 Mini eCommerce Microservices System

Simple microservices-based eCommerce backend built with **Java + Spring Boot + Kafka + Docker Compose**.

---

# 🚀 Architecture Overview

The system consists of 3 microservices:

* **product-service** → manages product catalog
* **order-service** → handles order creation
* **inventory-service** → manages stock

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project was to design and implement a microservices-based system
with both synchronous (REST) and asynchronous (Kafka) communication.

It simulates a real-world eCommerce order flow with stock validation and event-driven updates.

Kafka (OrderCreatedEvent)

  v
inventory-service (updates stock)

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Microservices decomposition
- REST vs event-driven communication
- Data consistency in distributed systems
- Basic resilience (rate limiting)
- Performance optimization (caching)

# 🔁 Business Flow

1. Client sends request to create an order
2. `order-service` checks product availability via `inventory-service` (REST)
3. If available → order is created
4. `order-service` publishes `OrderCreatedEvent` to Kafka
5. `inventory-service` consumes event and updates stock

# 🔧 Features

### ✅ Microservices architecture

* Independent services
* Clear separation of concerns

### ✅ Synchronous communication

* REST call:
  `order-service → inventory-service`

### ✅ Asynchronous communication

* Kafka event-driven flow:

    * `OrderCreatedEvent`

### ✅ Caching

* Implemented in `product-service`
* Reduces repeated reads

### ✅ Rate limiting

* Implemented in `order-service`
* Protects `/orders` endpoint

### ✅ Global exception handling

* Consistent API error responses
* No default Whitelabel errors

### ✅ Swagger UI

* Interactive API documentation
* No need for Postman

# 🐳 Run with Docker

## 1. Build JARs

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

## 2. Run system

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

---

# 🔍 Example Flow

1. Check stock:

```http
GET /inventory/stock?productId=1
```

2. Create order:

```http
POST /orders
```

3. Kafka event is published

4. Inventory updates stock
